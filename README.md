# Object-Oriented Programming in Java  

This project is a collection of practice programs and examples built to strengthen my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles using Java. The goal was to apply theoretical concepts into practical coding exercises, focusing on **clean code, reusability, and design fundamentals**.  

## 🚀 Features & Concepts Covered  
- **Encapsulation** – Creating classes with private fields and public getters/setters.  
- **Inheritance** – Building class hierarchies to reuse and extend functionality.  
- **Polymorphism** – Implementing method overloading and overriding.  
- **Abstraction** – Using abstract classes and interfaces for flexible design.  
- **File Handling & Basic I/O** – Working with input and output streams.  
- **Error Handling** – Applying try-catch blocks and exception handling.  

## 🛠️ Technologies  
- **Language:** Java  
- **Tools:** GitHub, IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (optional IDE)
