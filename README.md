Library management system 
We selected this title for our project because, most of the time we have problem finding 
books in our own library that the teacher has given us the title to. Many similar books 
are found but finding the exact reference is a little bit hard. So we hope such system 
makes the process easier and faster.
The scope of the project is to create a system that gives ease of access and efficient 
management to a library system. 
The system allows the library admin to inter the books that are available and make it 
accessible for students to search and check the availability. The students then are able 
to search easily with their access privileges to be able to access it.
The project is intended to have 2 users the Librarian and the Students. 
The librarian is supposed to update and edit or delete the database. While students are 
only able to access it ..

How it works. 
The initial process is the requirement of the user name and password that gets the 
proper authorization to the users. 
The user type gives the user where to go next.
The LIBRARIAN OR STUDENT section
The LIBRARIAN section
In case of the Librarian the interface takes them to the MOE digital library management. 
it takes Librarian to the section that is used to editing the information that are displayed 
and who accesses it. 
It has 3 icons to select the BOOKS, STUDENTS, and the logout.
The BOOKS icon takes to where the books information is added, deleted, cleared or 
updated. 
3
It has input section the contains
-book name
-book author
-file size
-file type
-subject
-book type
-grade
Selecting Table row gets to the JTextField . so that we can edit 
After the editing is completed a message is deployed.
4
The STUDENT icon takes to where the student information is added, deleted, cleared or 
updated. 
After finishing the admin has an option to logout button to exit or continue.
STUDENT section
Is where the students can access the files, on the books that they want.
The books are displayed in the category which makes them easly accesable.
